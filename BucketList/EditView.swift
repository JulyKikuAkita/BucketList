 Q:  How can we pass the new location data back?
 - If use @Binding to pass in a remote value, it creates problems with our optional in ContentView: we want EditView to be bound to a real value rather than an optional value
 - onSave: (Location) -> Void: a function to call where we can pass back whatever new location we want.

     which allows us to create an instance of the property wrapper not the data inside the wrapper.

     @escaping means the function is being stashed away for user later on, rather than being called immediately, and itâ€™s needed here because the onSave function will get called only when the user presses Save.
